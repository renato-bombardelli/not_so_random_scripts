# not_so_random_scripts
Some scripts made to work with CSV files, rename things, extract some information, etc...

Well, basically, in here I save some scripts that I have written in Python to do some tasks and make my analysis easier.
I often use them as a template to do some similar tasks with other files containing generally data from transcriptomic analysis.

If for some reason someome someday things it can be usefull for them, I will be very pleased for have shared it in here^^
